OOPS:
we have two types of programming languages
 i.Procedural Oriented Programming language
ii.Object Oriented Programming language
Java is an Object Oriented Programming language
 lot of differences makes OOPS better than the POP.they are;
*In OOPS,the concentration wiil be given on the objects and classes where as in POP the concentration wiil be given on the 
  procedures.
*In OOPS,the object to object communication done through methods.
*In OOPS,data and methodsthat work on data will be combined into a single unit called class.
*OOP lets you extend a program without having to touch previously working code.
*OOP provides greater flexibility and reusability and extensibility.
PRINCIPLES OF OOPS:
 There are four principles of OOPS,they are;
1.Inheritance
2.Polymorphism
3.Encapsulation
4.Abstraction

1.Inheritance:
  deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes aquires all the features of existing classes is 
called as "Inheritance".
Advantages:
*Redundancy of the code is reduced.
*Reduces code size.

2.Polymorphism:
  Polymorphism means ability to take more than one forms.
*Polymorphism allows objects that having different internal structures to share the same external interface.
*Extensively used in implementing the inheritance.

3.Encapsulation:
  Wrapping up of data and methods that manipulates the data into a single unit is called as "Encapsulation".
*data is not accessible to outside world and only methods can access it.
*Encapsulation is used for data hiding.

4.Abstraction:
  Abstraction is a process of hiding all unnecessary implementation details and exposing only the required 
 functionalities.
